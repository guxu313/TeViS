# Translating Text Synopses to Video Storyboards

## What is TeViS task?

In order to reduce the gap between existing tasks and realistic needs for storyboard creation, we propose a new task called Text synopsis to Video Storyboard (TeViS). In the TeViS task, we aim to retrieve an ordered sequence of images from large-scale movie database as video storyboard to visualize an input text synopsis.

## What is MovieNet-TeViS Dataset?

In the TeViS task, we aim to retrieve an ordered sequence of images from large-scale movie database as video storyboard to visualize an input text synopsis. For this purpose, we collect the MovieNet-TeViS benchmark based on the public MovieNet dataset.
The following figure shows how we differ from existing tasks, other datasets.

We will soon release the ablation details and accompanying code. Thank you for your patience.
